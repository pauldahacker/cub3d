## Overview

CUB3D is a 3D graphics engine that uses raycasting to create a pseudo-3D environment from a 2D map. The engine casts rays from the player's position in different directions to determine wall distances and render the 3D scene. This technique was famously used in early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features

- **3D Raycasting Engine**: Real-time 3D rendering using raycasting algorithm
- **Texture Mapping**: Support for wall textures (North, South, East, West)
- **Player Movement**: WASD keys for movement, arrow keys for rotation
- **Collision Detection**: Wall collision detection and boundary checking
- **Minimap**: 2D overhead view of the map with player position and FOV
- **Color Customization**: Configurable floor and ceiling colors
- **Cross-platform**: Support for both Linux and macOS

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- Make
- MLX graphics library (included in the project)

### Build Instructions
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cub3d
make
```

## Usage

```bash
./cub3d <map_file.cub>
```

### Controls
- **W/A/S/D**: Move forward/left/backward/right

## Parsing

PARSING LOGIC:

(0)	Quick file-check for correct extension and readable file.  
(1)	Using **get_next_line2**, we open and read the file a first time to add  
	the **textures, colors and the map dimensions** in a t_game structure.  
	**ALL texture and color formatting errors are handled here:**  
		- Correct identifiers for textures and colors.  
		- Openable paths for textures.  
		- Correct formatting for colors (r,g,b with 0 <= (r,g,b) <= 255).  
		- Empty lines between every type of element are ok.  
		- Textures and colors can be listed then read in any order.  
		- Spaces between each element's information are ok.  
		- No repeated identifiers.  
		- No missing elements.  
		- No unkown identifiers or elements.  
		- Textures and colors must come before the map content.  
	The following map specifics are checked:  
		- Lines between the textures/colors and game map are empty.  
		- Map content consists of only {0,1,N,S,W,E} or spaces.  
		- There is only one player.  
		- No empty lines within the map content.  
		- No unknown element(s) found in the map.  
	If an error is found before the end of file, everything is destroyed,
	the file is closed, and the program stops here.
	If no error is found after the end of file, we close the file.
(2)	After finding the map dimensions in (1), we can allocate the right amount 
	of memory for the map.
	Using get_next_line2, we open and read the file a second time to add
	the map content in the t_game structure.
	We close the file.
(3) 	Once the map content has been added, we can check if the map is playable.
		**Flood-filling:**
 		Starting at the player position, it marks the current element in the map
		as VISITED if **it is not a wall and not already visited**.
  		Then it moves north, south, east and west and repeats.
		If the current position is a wall, return.
		If the current position is at the border and is a floor, the map is not closed.

## Raycasting Implementation

The raycasting engine is the core of this project. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

### 1. Core Concepts

#### Field of View (FOV)
- **FOV**: 60 degrees (configurable in `raycasting.h`)
- **Ray Count**: One ray per pixel column (1600 rays for 1600px width)
- **Ray Angle Increment**: `FOV / WINDOW_X` degrees between rays

#### Player Structure
```c
typedef struct raycasting
{
    double pos_x;                    // Player X position in pixels
    double pos_y;                    // Player Y position in pixels
    double angle_start;              // Leftmost ray angle
    double angle_end;                // Rightmost ray angle
    double middle_fov_angle;         // Center ray angle
    double ray_angle;                // Current ray angle
    double subsequent_angle;         // Angle increment between rays
    bool horizontal_distance_chosen; // Which intersection was chosen
    t_proj proj_plan;               // Projection plane data
    t_block point_hit;              // Wall intersection point
    double projected_wall_height;    // Wall height on screen
    double distance_to_wall;        // Distance to wall
    double horizontal_wall_size_in_px; // Wall size in pixels
} t_player;
```

### 2. Raycasting Algorithm

The algorithm follows these steps for each ray:

#### Step 1: Ray Direction Calculation
```c
// In draw_every_ray()
player->ray_angle = player->angle_start;
player->subsequent_angle = FOV / PROJ_PLANE_X; // 60° / 1600 = 0.0375°

while (player->ray_angle > player->angle_end)
{
    // Cast ray and calculate distance
    player->distance_to_wall = calculate_best_distance(vars);
    // Draw the vertical line
    draw_raycasting(vars, &x, &y);
    player->ray_angle -= player->subsequent_angle;
}
```

#### Step 2: DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) Algorithm

The engine uses DDA to find wall intersections efficiently:

**Horizontal Intersection** (`horizontal_intersection.c`):
```c
t_block horizontal_point_crossing_wall(t_vars *vars)
{
    // Find first horizontal grid line intersection
    t_block first_point = find_coordinate_of_first_horizontal_point(vars);
    
    // Step along horizontal grid lines until hitting a wall
    while (map[y][x] == 'V' && wall_not_in_diagonal(vars, current_block))
    {
        next_point = find_next_horizontal_point(current_point, ray_angle);
        // Check if next point is a wall
    }
    return intersection_point;
}
```

**Vertical Intersection** (`vertical_intersection.c`):
```c
t_block vertical_point_crossing_wall(t_vars *vars)
{
    // Find first vertical grid line intersection
    t_block first_point = find_coordinate_of_first_vertical_point(vars);
    
    // Step along vertical grid lines until hitting a wall
    while (map[y][x] == 'V' && wall_not_in_diagonal(vars, current_block))
    {
        next_point = find_next_vertical_point(current_point, ray_angle);
        // Check if next point is a wall
    }
    return intersection_point;
}
```

#### Step 3: Distance Calculation

For each ray, both horizontal and vertical intersections are calculated, then the shortest distance is chosen:

```c
double calculate_best_distance(t_vars *vars)
{
    t_block horizontal_pt = horizontal_point_crossing_wall(vars);
    double horizontal_distance = calculate_hypo_distance(vars, horizontal_pt);
    
    t_block vertical_pt = vertical_point_crossing_wall(vars);
    double vertical_distance = calculate_hypo_distance(vars, vertical_pt);
    
    // Choose the shorter distance
    if (vertical_distance < horizontal_distance)
    {
        vars->game->player->horizontal_distance_chosen = false;
        return vertical_distance;
    }
    else
    {
        vars->game->player->horizontal_distance_chosen = true;
        return horizontal_distance;
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Fishbowl Effect Correction

The fishbowl effect is corrected using the cosine of the angle difference:

```c
static double calculate_hypo_distance(t_vars *vars, t_block point)
{
    double distance = sqrt((pos_x - point.x)² + (pos_y - point.y)²);
    double beta = middle_fov_angle - ray_angle;
    return distance * cos(beta * (PI / 180.0));
}
```

#### Step 5: Wall Height Calculation

Wall height is calculated using similar triangles:

```c
static double calculate_projected_wall_height(t_vars *vars)
{
    double actual_wall_height = BLOCK_SIZE; // 64 pixels
    double projected_wall_height = (actual_wall_height / distance_to_wall) 
                                  * distance_player_pplan;
    return projected_wall_height;
}
```

#### Step 6: Rendering

Each ray draws a vertical line (column) on the screen:

```c
static void draw_raycasting(t_vars *vars, int *x, int *y)
{
    // Calculate wall top and bottom positions
    wall_top = center_y - projected_height / 2;
    wall_bottom = center_y + projected_height / 2;
    
    // Draw ceiling, wall, and floor
    for (int y = 0; y < WINDOW_Y; y++)
    {
        if (y < wall_top)
            draw_ceiling_pixel(x, y);
        else if (y >= wall_top && y <= wall_bottom)
            draw_wall_pixel(x, y); // With texture mapping
        else
            draw_floor_pixel(x, y);
    }
}
```

### 3. Key Mathematical Concepts

#### Trigonometry Used
- **Tangent**: Used to find intersection points with grid lines
- **Cosine**: Used for fishbowl effect correction
- **Pythagorean Theorem**: Used to calculate distances

#### Coordinate Systems
- **World Coordinates**: Player position in pixels
- **Grid Coordinates**: Map array indices
- **Screen Coordinates**: Pixel positions on the display

#### Projection Plane
- **Distance to Projection Plane**: `(PROJ_PLANE_X/2) / tan(FOV/2)`
- **Wall Height Formula**: `(actual_height / distance) * projection_distance`
